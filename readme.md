This repository contains the Mathematica scripts (.m files) that can determine an old nearby neutron star could be destroyed by the dark-matter-forming black hole inside it or not. See `tutorial.nb` for quick usage.

The method is based on J. Bramante *et al.*, Phys. Rev. D **89**, 015010 (2014) [arXiv:1310.3509 [hep-ph]]

The reproduction of the exclusion plots of the upper and middle panels of Fig. 1 in C. Kouvaris, Phys. Rev. Lett. **108**, 191301 (2012) are given in the *results* folder Including \(\alpha=10^{-2}\) and \(10^{-5}\). Beige color is excluded due to the star is consumed by the black hole. Numerical data are given as well, arranged in \(m_\chi,m_{\phi},{\rm True/False}\).
